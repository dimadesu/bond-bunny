# Bond Bunny. SRT to SRTLA Bonding App for Android

This is Android app that allows listening on local port for SRT stream and then forwarding SRT packets via multiple connections, such as cellular, Wi-Fi and Ethernet, to remote SRTLA server like [Belabox Cloud](https://belabox.net/). This process is also known as bonding.

This is compatible with any apps that can stream SRT and it essentially extends them with bonding on the same device.

Android implementation of [SRTLA](https://github.com/BELABOX/srtla).

Some ideas borrowed from [Moblin](https://github.com/eerimoq/moblin) and [Moblink](https://github.com/eerimoq/moblink).
