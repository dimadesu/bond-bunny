# SRTLA Crash Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: NullPointerException in CleanSrtlaService.setupNetworkMonitoring()

**Problem**: The `activeRequests` ConcurrentHashMap was trying to accept a `null` key, which is not allowed.

**Root Cause**: Line 155 had `activeRequests.put(null, wifiBuilder)` which attempted to use `null` as a key in a ConcurrentHashMap.

**Fix Applied**:

1. Removed the problematic line that was causing the null key insertion
2. Removed the unused `activeRequests` field entirely since it wasn't serving any meaningful purpose
3. Simplified the network monitoring setup to focus only on tracking actual network connections

## Issue 2: Improved Local IP Detection

**Problem**: The original `getLocalIpForNetwork()` method was using hardcoded placeholder IP addresses, causing network binding failures.

**Root Cause**: Method returned static IPs like "192.168.1.100" instead of determining actual network interface IPs.

**Fix Applied**:

1. Implemented proper IP detection using Android's `LinkProperties` API
2. Added fallback method using socket binding to determine actual local IP
3. Added proper imports for networking classes (`LinkAddress`, `LinkProperties`, etc.)

## Files Modified:

- `/Users/dmytro.antonov/git/bond-bunny/src/main/java/com/example/srtla/CleanSrtlaService.java`

## Build Status:

✅ **Build Successful** - All fixes applied without compilation errors
✅ **APK Generated** - Debug APK ready for testing (8.5MB)
✅ **Lint Clean** - No new lint errors introduced

## Expected Results:

- No more NullPointerException crashes on service start
- Proper network IP detection for WiFi and cellular connections
- Successful SRTLA connection binding to actual network interfaces

## Testing Recommendation:

The fixed APK should now start the CleanSrtlaService without crashing and properly detect real local IP addresses for network binding.
