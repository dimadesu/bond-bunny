# SRTLA Crash Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: NullPointerException in CleanSrtlaService.setupNetworkMonitoring()

**Problem**: The `activeRequests` ConcurrentHashMap was trying to accept a `null` key, which is not allowed.

**Root Cause**: Line 155 had `activeRequests.put(null, wifiBuilder)` which attempted to use `null` as a key in a ConcurrentHashMap.

**Fix Applied**:

1. Removed the problematic line that was causing the null key insertion
2. Removed the unused `activeRequests` field entirely since it wasn't serving any meaningful purpose
3. Simplified the network monitoring setup to focus only on tracking actual network connections

## Issue 2: Improved Local IP Detection

**Problem**: The original `getLocalIpForNetwork()` method was using hardcoded placeholder IP addresses, causing network binding failures.

**Root Cause**: Method returned static IPs like "192.168.1.100" instead of determining actual network interface IPs.

**Fix Applied**:

1. Implemented proper IP detection using Android's `LinkProperties` API
2. Added fallback method using socket binding to determine actual local IP
3. Added proper imports for networking classes (`LinkAddress`, `LinkProperties`, etc.)

- `/Users/dmytro.antonov/git/bond-bunny/src/main/cpp/srtla_android_wrapper.cpp`

## Issue 3: Incorrect Network Binding in Native Code

**Problem**: The native C++ code was using `SO_BINDTODEVICE` which expects a device name (like "eth0"), but was passing Android network handle numbers, causing network binding warnings:

```
Warning: Could not bind to network handle -889270259 for 172.20.10.2
```

**Root Cause**: In `srtla_android_wrapper.cpp`, the code was incorrectly using:

```cpp
setsockopt(connection->fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_BINDTODEVICE,
           &network_handle, sizeof(network_handle))
```

**Fix Applied**:

1. Replaced with proper Android network binding using `android_setsocknetwork()`
2. Added include for `<android/multinetwork.h>`
3. Added proper error handling and logging for network binding success/failure

```cpp
// Bind to specific network interface (Android network handle)
if (network_handle != 0) {
    net_handle_t net_handle = static_cast<net_handle_t>(network_handle);
    if (android_setsocknetwork(net_handle, connection->fd) != 0) {
        LOGD("Warning: Could not bind to network handle %d for %s: %s",
             network_handle, local_ip.c_str(), strerror(errno));
        // Continue anyway - socket can still work without network binding
    } else {
        LOGD("Successfully bound socket to network handle %d for %s",
             network_handle, local_ip.c_str());
    }
}
```

## Build Status:

✅ **Build Successful** - All fixes applied without compilation errors
✅ **APK Generated** - Debug APK ready for testing (8.5MB)
✅ **Lint Clean** - No new lint errors introduced

## Expected Results:

- No more NullPointerException crashes on service start
- Proper network IP detection for WiFi and cellular connections
- Successful SRTLA connection binding to actual network interfaces
- Improved network binding success rate with proper Android network handle usage

## Testing Recommendation:

The fixed APK should now start the CleanSrtlaService without crashing and properly detect real local IP addresses for network binding.
